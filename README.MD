# Code a Fill-in-the-Blanks Quiz - Stage 2

This repository contains the python code file to run a fill in the blanks quiz for Udacity's Intro to Programming.

## Overview

For this stage I have built a fill-in-the-blanks quiz. Your quiz will prompt a user with a sentence containing several blanks. The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the sentence. 

## How to run the application

Download the repository to your computer, unzip, and then open the index.html in your preferred browser.
